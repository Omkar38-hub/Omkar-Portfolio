      <h1 class="blog-name">Why Hostel Life is the best experience ever?</h1>
      <small>September, 2021</small>
      <p>
        Hello, I am going to tell you about the best experience of life which is
        called hostel life. Apart from the value of home-cooked food, love of family members, borrowing interest-free loans from hostel mates,
         late night sleep it teaches many deals more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hostel life can transform our personality completely. Stepping out of the comfort of home equips us with all the essential life skills we need to survive.
        Here are the top 6 reasons through which I am going to mention why hostel life is the best experience ever?
      </p>
      <h2>1. Lifelong Connections</h2>
      <p>
        In the hostel, we will be going to connect with people from different places with different cultures and backgrounds. They become the first people other than family
        members with whom we share everything. We live with them, eat with them, share our problems with each other, celebrate together. With that amazing sort of people who
        will not let us feel homesick and gradually hotel will become our second home. That bonds with hostel mates will endure forever.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Sense Of Adaptability</h2>
      <p>
        In the hostel we will learn to do the things which we have not to care about till now in our homes as like taking meals on time, washing clothes by own,
        taking care of health and cleanliness and many more. In the hostel, we grow emotionally, mentally, psychologically and physically. While we also learn to deal with new situations,
        difficult times, solve our own problems, protect ourselves, manage our lives, live independently, we grow mentally. But all these challenges will make us adaptable to the environment and impulse you with the new adventure of life.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Independence</h2>
      <p>
        Independence is something for which we are longing at home. In a hostel, we are accountable for everything from getting up in the morning, preparing for
        midnight birthdays surprises, watching late night movies, long conversations on random topics.  and whatnot. This independence in turn teaches us a lot and play a major role in making us a better person.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Time management</h2>
      <p>
        Apart from study, we will learn to manage time for the gossip sessions and all other sorts of activities like getting up in the morning, having meals,
        washing clothes and many more that you are required to do in a hostel. This skill improves our decision-making ability.
      </p>
      <h2>5. Opportunities</h2>
      <p>
        In a hostel, we are free to go about exploring numerous fields that we have never set out before in a new place among new people which signifies the
         opening of new doors that you canâ€™t take being at home. Here, we get to meet new people and consequently get involved in newer things which will make us self reliant.
      </p>
      <h2>6. Exposure</h2>
      <p>
        Hostel life is very much different from how we used to live at home. We learn to fit in a new place and are exposed to many situations, in particular, making new friends,
        adjusting to a whole new environment, doing things on our own, taking initiative and living with freedom. We come across many things, and some are significant while some are not.
        It gives us chance to learn and experience new things.
      </p>
      <p>
      The great advantage of hostel life is the priceless experience that remains a lesson for life. No doubt Experience is the most significant aspect of living in
      a hostel, with all that we get from there which is friends, independence, freedom, responsibilities, opportunities or exposure, all sum up to give us new experiences.
